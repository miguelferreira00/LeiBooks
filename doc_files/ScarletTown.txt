Lyrics and translation for Scarlet Town by Chris Thile & Brad Mehldau

Buddy I went down to Scarlet Town
Ain't never been there before
You slept on a featherbed

And I slept on the floor
Buddy I don't mind a mean ol' time
Oh drinkin' my coffee cold
But the things I've seen in Scarlet Town
Did mortify my soul

I look at that deep well
I look at that dark grave
Ringin' that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

Spent some time in New Orleans
Carol on a Ben
Scarlet Town brought me down
As low as I ever been

I look at that deep well
I look at that dark grave
Ringin' that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

I went down to Scarlet Town
You promised you'd be my bride
Then you left me here to rot away
Like a poly on a mountain side

I look at that deep well
I look at that dark grave
Ringin' that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

Buddy you can hide in Scarlet Town
For a hundred years or more
But the man who knows what time it is
Is knockin' at the door
So fare thee well my own true love
If you ever see me around
I'll be lookin' through a telescope
From Hell to Scarlet Town

I look at that deep well
I look at that dark grave
Ringin' that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

I look at that deep well (look at that deep well)
Look at that dark grave (I look at that dark grave)
Ringin' that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today
